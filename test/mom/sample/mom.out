     The equations are Boussinesq, and so conserve volume rather than mass.
     Use one of the pressure-like coordinates to get non-Boussinesq effects.

 The shallowest wet ocean model grid cell has depth (meters)     40.00000
 and this occurs at (i,j,k) = ( 59, 16,  4)
 which has (long,lat,depth) =  ( -221.5000,  -66.5000,    40.00000)

 Beware that shallow regions (e.g., those shallower than 50m) may be subject
 to numerical problems if strong surface forcing is not mixed vertically.
 Such problems may occur especially in shallow regions with kmt==2.
 Current speeds and/or tracer deviations may become large due to the deposition
 of wind and/or buoyancy over just a small upper ocean region. Such problems
 can be resolved by adding sufficient vertical mixing in these regions.
 Such happens in Nature due to tides and breaking surface waves.

NOTE from PE     0: Using barotropic predictor-corrector for integrating barotropic dynamics.

 Predictor-Corrector time filter on barotropic dynamics has value=   0.20

 Updating eta_t or pbot_t using a big time step as in MOM4.0. Not recommended for OBC applications.

 Initialise sum of barotropic sea level with eta_t or pbot_t. This is the default. 

  ==> Note: The barotropic dynamics integrate  160 timesteps for every one baroclinic timestep.

 ==>Using smooth_eta_t_biharmonic to smooth eta_t. Can produce extrema. Not recommended.

 Barotropic stability most nearly violated at T-cell (i,j) = (  90, 200), (lon,lat) = (  -202.50,    89.49).
         The number of kmt-levels at this point is     47

         The dyt grid spacing (m) at this point is 0.111200E+06
         where the barotropic gravity wave speed is ~232.0 m/s.

---Neutral direction slope check I for linear stability of neutral diffusion---

the most stringent linear stability constraint was found at the following ocean cell:

lat (  92,   5)                   = -0.7750000E+02

delta_iso           =  0.3714141E-01 is the maximum neutral direction slope
available for linear stability of the neutral diffusion scheme.
The namelist parameter smax should conservatively be <= delta_iso.


---Neutral direction slope check II for linear stability of neutral diffusion---
Assuming maximum Redi neutral diffusion slope of  0.5000000E-02
and neutral physics time step (secs) of  0.5400000E+04
the most stringent linear stability constraint was found at the following ocean cell:
long(   1,   1)                  = -0.2795000E+03
lat (   1,   1)                  = -0.8150000E+02
thick(   1,   1,   1)=  0.1000000E+02
A_max      =  0.3043640E+04 (m^2/sec) is the maximum neutral diffusivity
available for linear stability of the neutral diffusion scheme.
Conservatively, neutral diffusivities used in the model should be less than A_max.
